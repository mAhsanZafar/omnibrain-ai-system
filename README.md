# OmniBrain AI System
### A Multi-Source, Self-Modifying Artificial Intelligence Framework

OmniBrain AI System is an experimental, multi-modal artificial intelligence framework designed to ingest knowledge from diverse sources—documents, books, web content, videos, and structured data—and transform it into adaptive intelligence.

The system integrates classical machine learning, deep learning (CNNs), evolutionary optimization, and large language models to create a self-training, self-modifying AI core. It includes assistant-level orchestration (Jarvis-style interaction), automated model selection, and continuous learning pipelines.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

* **Multi-source Knowledge Ingestion:** Automated processing of PDFs, eBooks, YouTube transcripts, Google Search results, and custom datasets.
* **Self-Modifying Architecture:** Evolutionary algorithms that allow the system (SMAI.py) to optimize its own parameters.
* **Deep Learning Integration:** Full pipelines for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
* **AI Coding Assistant:** Integrated code-generation capabilities powered by CodeT5 (CMAI.py).
* **Jarvis-Style Orchestration:** A central assistant interface to manage tasks and interact with the user.
* **Persistence & Versioning:** Models are stored and versioned via `.pkl` files for continuous learning.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The repository is structured to separate the "brain" (core logic) from the "inputs" (datasets) and "outputs" (assistant interfaces).

* **CMAI.py**: Code-generation and technical assistant.
* **SMAI.py**: The self-modifying core using evolutionary optimization.
* **Ingestion Engines**: Specialized modules for PDF, YouTube, and Web scraping.
* **Model Zoo**: Storage for trained `.pkl` models and CNN configurations.
